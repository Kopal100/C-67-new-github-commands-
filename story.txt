There was once a zebra who loved his forest and the stream that ran near it. But most of all he liked the vivid colors of the jungle. He always 
wanted to be colorful but unfortunately had only black and white stripes. One day his friend the peacock visited him and the zebra shared his
grief with him. The peacock first laughed but then decided to help him. He introduced the zebra to paints which he then used to paint 
his friend zebra's body. However when the peacock was finished and when he saw himself in the mirror, to his astonishment, he did not recognise
himself. He began running to and fro all around the room. Immidiately the peacock poured a bucket of water on him to remove the paint.
Finally upon seeing his old black and white stripes the zebra was relieved and made a decision to embrace himself in his truest form.
