There was once a zebra who loved his forest and the stream that ran near it. But most of all he liked the vivid colors of the jungle. He always 
wanted to be colorful but unfortunately had only black and white stripes. One day his friend the peacock visited him and the zebra shared his
grief with him. The peacock first laughed but then decided to help him. He introduced the zebra to paints which he then used to paint 
his friend zebra's body. Upon finishing, when the zebra saw himself in the mirror, he was beautifully covered with bright shining colors. 
He was very happy and invited the entire forst for a party that evening to thank his friend peacock.
